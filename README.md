# Nova Financial News Sentiment Analysis

# Project Description

This project focuses on the detailed analysis of a large corpus of financial news data to discover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. The objective is to enhance the predictive analytics capabilities of Nova Financial Solutions, a financial company, to significantly boost its financial forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency through advanced data analysis.

The project consists of two main tasks:

1. Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on the 'headline' text to quantify the tone and sentiment expressed in financial news. This involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive sentiment scores, which can be associated with the respective 'Stock Symbol' to understand the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.

2. Correlation Analysis: Establish statistical correlations between the sentiment derived from news articles and the corresponding stock price movements. This analysis involves tracking stock price changes around the date the article was published and analyzing the impact of news sentiment on stock performance. The analysis should consider the publication date and potentially the time the article was published if such data can be inferred or is available.

The project requires proficiency in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE). It will enhance skills in analyzing complex datasets, demonstrating adaptability, and employing innovative thinking skills that are crucial for the demanding environment at Nova Financial Insights.

The final report should provide clear, actionable insights based on the sentiment and correlation analysis, offering innovative strategies to use news sentiment as a predictive tool for stock market trends.
